These are the demos we wrote for the Workshop I gave for [try! Swift World](https://www.tryswift.co/world/) titled "An Overview of the Modern Concurrency Features Introduced in Swift 5.5." on September 17, 2021.

The app contains three projects:

1. **Demos**: Contains four demos for the following contexts: Structured Concurrency with `async let`, Structured Concurrency with `Task Groups`, Unstructed Concurrency with `Task`, and actors.
2. **ContactPicker**: A sample project that shows we can convert delegate-based code into async/await.
3. **AsyncStreamDemo2**: Shows how we can make use of `AsyncStream` and subsequently `for await` loops.

Additionally, it contains the Slides for the presentation (`ModernConcurrencyWorkshopSWWSept2021.key`)
