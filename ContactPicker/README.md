This demo (UIKit) shows how we can convert delegate-based code into async/await using Checked Continuations. The same ideas can be applied to convert closure-based code.

The project is a contact picker app were we use the `ContactsUI` framework. We show the user a contact picker and let them choose a contact. The code uses async/await after briding the delegate-based code.
