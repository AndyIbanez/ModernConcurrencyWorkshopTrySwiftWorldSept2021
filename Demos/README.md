This project is a TabView-based app (SwiftUI) where each tab contains a different demo:

1. Structured Concurrency with `async let`.
2. Structured Concurrency with `Task Groups`
3. Unstructed Concurrency with `Task {}`
4. Using `actor`s.

Each demo is isolated in its own view to make them easier to modify without worrying about breaking the other demos.
